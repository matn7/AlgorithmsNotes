## Combination Sum 2
Backtrack problem. Similar to Combination Sum 1. Do not allow reuse the same number multiple time. Sort input. Regular
backtrack with move to next arr elements every iteration. For recurring case loop until unique element will be picked to 
next iteration.

## Permutations
Backtrack problem, create cache which will check which num was picked. Loop through all nums elements, skip already picked.
Base case if temp res is size of nums. Time O(n! * n) | Space O(n! * n).
